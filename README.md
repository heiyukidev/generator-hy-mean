## Start Developing

Open a Terminal, One terminal that will act as your app's server (Express.js server):
```bash
npm run dev-server
```
>This server will automaticly restart when changes are introduced

then open second Terminal, One terminal that will act as your File Watcher (Using Gulp):
```bash

```

>This server will automaticly Concat and minify when changes are introduced to your Front end Code

## Installing new Bower dependencies

All new Bower Javascript dependencies have to be included in gulpfile.js in the libs section
This process is required for gulp to read those libraries

### IMPORTANT!
Adding javascript files outised of the components/pages/assets folders will not be visible to Gulp.
Any file outside of javascript (like CSS) will have to be added in manually into index.html

>reason is I don't write my own css so it's not in my build system

## Run your Application

To run your Application you simply Use:
```bash
npm start
```
